# Employee-Directory

This project is a practice example of working with data provided from an
API. The script connects to the API provided by randomuser.me, requests
twelve random users, and creates an employee entry for each from the data retrieved:
Picture, Name, Email, and City.

Clicking on any employee entry, the site creates a modal with more detailed
information about the selected employee including: Picture, Name, Username, Email,
City, Phone Number, Address, and Birthday. Clicking anywhere outside the modal
causes the modal to close. The modal contains 'Prev' and 'Next' buttons and when
clicked, the modal will update to show the appropriate data for whichever
employee comes previously or next in the listing.

Lastly the script will show or hide employees on the page on keyup events performed
on the input field so that employees can be filtered based on search queries.
